# AI-Music-Generator
1. A simple music generator that uses an LSTM network to generate a melody using a starting sequence. </br>
2. The generated melody is stored in the "generated_samples" folder and the length of the generated track can be changed in the ipynb file. </br>
3. "model.hdf5" can be directly loaded to generate a melody or a new model can be trained from scratch(takes a long time) using the songs given in "training_songs" folder. </br>
